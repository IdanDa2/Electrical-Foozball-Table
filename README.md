# Electrical-Foozball-Table
Traditional foozball table with some features.

In this project I created a prototype of Electrical foozball table.
practically I've added some electrical features to the traditional foozball such as sounds, LED surface presenting the score and when a goal is scored,
camera and screen to watch the match live and goal replays and eventually a highlights .

This game is designed for 2-4 players in two teams. The first team to score 10 goals is the winner.
At first, each team choose their Favorite team (currently there's only four teams from the israeli main football league).
Based on their choice, each team is assigned a song and color that represents the team they have chosen.
The camera start's filming and the live broadcast is desplayed on a screen during the game.
the moment a goal is scored few things occur simultaniously:
- The score is updated and presented on the RGB LED surface according to the teams colors.
- The live broadcast stops and a replay of the last move is displayed.
- Israeli football broadcaster is played through speakers screaming in Hebrew "What an astonishing goal"
Next, during the game you can hear the crowd of the leading team cheering and singing a song of the same team.
When a team scores 10 goal the game is over.
On the LED surface it will be written: "winner" and the score
Few moments later, the game highlights will be shown on the screen

End of project
